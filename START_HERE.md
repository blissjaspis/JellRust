## 🔧 First Steps (Right Now)

### Step 1: Build It (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/mac/Documents/Koding/Rust/JellRust

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# The binary is at: target/release/jellrust
```

### Step 2: Test It (1 minute)

```bash
# Create a test site
./target/release/jellrust new test-site

# Go into it
cd test-site

# Start the server
../target/release/jellrust serve

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### For Users

## 💡 Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Static Site Generator Flow
```
Markdown + Templates → HTML → Deploy
```

### 2. Jekyll Compatibility
JellRust uses the same concepts:
- `_config.yml` for configuration
- `_posts/` for blog posts
- `_layouts/` for HTML templates
- `_includes/` for partials
- Front matter with `---`

### 3. Rust Workspace
Multiple crates working together:
- `jellrust-cli` → talks to user
- `jellrust-core` → orchestrates everything
- `jellrust-markdown` → converts MD to HTML
- `jellrust-template` → renders templates
- `jellrust-server` → serves files

### 4. Build Process
```
1. Read _config.yml
2. Find all .md files
3. Parse front matter
4. Render Markdown → HTML
5. Apply templates
6. Write to _site/
7. Copy static files
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Update Rust
rustup update

# Clean and rebuild
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```

### Tests Fail
```bash
# Some tests might fail because we're in MVP stage
# This is expected - Phase 1 of roadmap is to fix this
cargo test 2>&1 | grep "test result"
```

### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Try different port
./target/release/jellrust serve --port 3000
```
